 * Stabilizes the function passed so it's always the same between renders.
 *
 * The function becomes non-reactive to any values it captures.
 * It can safely be passed as a dependency of `React.useMemo` and `React.useEffect` without re-triggering them if its captured values change.
 *
 * The function must only be called inside effects and event handlers, never during render (which throws an error).
 *
 * This hook is a more permissive version of React 19.2's `React.useEffectEvent` in that it can be passed through contexts and called in event handler props, not just effects.
